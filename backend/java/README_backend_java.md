# 📘 Java – Backend

This folder contains hands-on practice, notes, and projects built with **Java**, covering everything from language fundamentals to real-world backend applications using frameworks like Spring Boot.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Master Java syntax, OOP, and core features
- Apply advanced concepts such as interfaces, streams, exceptions
- Build RESTful APIs using the Spring ecosystem
- Understand backend design principles and architecture patterns

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
backend/java/
├── basic/                 # Syntax, data types, control structures
├── advanced/              # OOP, interfaces, collections, error handling
├── frameworks/
│   └── spring/            # Spring Boot, MVC, REST APIs, security
├── projects/              # Real-world Java backend projects
└── README_backend_java.md
```

## 🚀 How to Use

Most examples can be run in IntelliJ IDEA or VSCode. If using Spring Boot, execute with Maven or Gradle:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## 📌 Notes

- This section is part of my [Architect Track](../../../) journey toward becoming a Full Stack Software Architect.
- All code is written for learning purposes and follows clean code practices where possible.
- Content evolves as I gain experience in real projects and architectural principles.
