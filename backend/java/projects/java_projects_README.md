# 📘 Java – Projects

This folder contains complete backend projects developed using **Java**, designed to simulate real-world applications and implement backend architecture principles.

## 📦 What You'll Find Here

These projects are progressively added as you master Java fundamentals and frameworks (like Spring Boot). Each project is a standalone challenge to apply what you've learned:

### 🔨 Recommended Projects

| Level | Project Name           | Description |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| 🟢 Basic | Bank Simulator         | Simulates basic banking operations using OOP |
| 🟢 Basic | Student Records App    | CLI app to manage student grades with arrays and files |
| 🟡 Intermediate | Employee API         | REST API using Spring Boot and MVC architecture |
| 🟡 Intermediate | Blog Service         | CRUD for blog posts and users, with database integration |
| 🔴 Advanced | Inventory System      | Spring Boot app with REST, database, and layered architecture |
| 🔴 Advanced | Microservice E-commerce | Multi-module Spring project with cart, products, and orders |

## 🚀 Running Projects

Each project includes its own `README.md` with setup instructions. Generally:

- For Spring Boot + Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- For Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## 📌 Notes

These projects are built incrementally, applying OOP, MVC, and Clean Architecture principles. Some integrate with databases and follow real deployment practices.
