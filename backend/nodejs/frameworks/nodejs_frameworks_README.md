# 🟩 Node.js – Frameworks

This folder contains backend frameworks built on top of **Node.js**, such as Express.js and NestJS. These frameworks help create structured, maintainable, and scalable applications for real-world use.

## 📦 Included Frameworks

- **Express.js** – Minimalist and fast web framework
- **NestJS** – Enterprise-grade framework based on TypeScript and modular architecture

Each subfolder contains hands-on examples and mini-projects for learning and applying backend logic.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
frameworks/
├── express/           # REST APIs, middleware, authentication
├── nest/              # Clean Architecture, modules, services, guards
└── README.md
```

Each framework includes:

- Mini projects by concept (auth, CRUD, static files, etc.)
- Use of common patterns like MVC, service layers, DTOs
- Focus on clean code, modularization, and separation of concerns

## 📌 Notes

This section prepares you to build full backend solutions with modern Node.js frameworks and bridges into full-stack and cloud architecture.
