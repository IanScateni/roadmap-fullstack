# 🟩 Node.js

This folder contains all learning content, exercises, and projects related to **Node.js** – the JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It serves as the foundation for modern backend development using JavaScript and TypeScript.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Node.js fundamentals and runtime behavior
- Practice backend logic with and without frameworks
- Learn how to build RESTful APIs and real-world backend services
- Apply architecture patterns such as MVC and Clean Architecture
- Develop projects using Express and NestJS frameworks
- Integrate Node.js with databases, authentication, and DevOps tools
