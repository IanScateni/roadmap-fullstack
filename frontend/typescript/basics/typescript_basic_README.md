- Enums and union types
- Type assertions
- DOM manipulation with TypeScript
- Compiler options and `tsconfig.json`

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run each file using `ts-node`, or compile it to JS:

```bash
npx ts-node types.ts
# or
tsc && node dist/types.js
```

## 📌 Notes

Once you're confident with these basics, you can move into more complex patterns and projects inside the `advanced/` folder.
