# 🔷 TypeScript (Frontend)

This folder contains examples, exercises, and small projects focused on using **TypeScript in frontend development**. TypeScript provides static typing and improves the robustness and maintainability of frontend applications.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn how to write safe and scalable frontend code
- Apply TypeScript to React, Vue, and plain JavaScript projects
- Understand interfaces, generics, types, and modules
- Use TypeScript with bundlers like Vite and Webpack

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Type annotations and type inference
- Interfaces and types
- Generics and enums
- DOM manipulation with TypeScript
- TS in React and Vue components
- tsconfig configuration
- Project structure for frontend TS apps

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
typescript/
├── basic/           # TypeScript syntax and standalone frontend logic
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
npx vite
```

Make sure `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` are present in each project.

## 📌 Notes

TypeScript is essential for building **robust**, **scalable**, and **enterprise-level** frontend applications. It also prepares you for full-stack TypeScript frameworks like Next.js or NestJS.
