# 🟨 JavaScript – Projects (Frontend)

This folder contains hands-on **JavaScript frontend projects**. Each one focuses on DOM manipulation, user interaction, and building dynamic UIs with vanilla JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Reinforce JS fundamentals through small web apps
- Practice real-world UI and logic without frameworks
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript only
- Implement form validation, localStorage, and APIs

## 🔨 Included Projects

| Name              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| BuscadorJS        | Search UI with dynamic filtering |
| CarritoDeCompras  | Add/remove items with totals using JS |
| criptomonedas     | Fetch and display crypto prices from API |
| EnviarMailJS      | Simulated email form with validations |

## 🚀 How to Run

## 📌 Notes

These projects form your **foundation** for moving to frameworks like React or Vue. Mastering vanilla JS is essential for understanding abstraction layers later on.
