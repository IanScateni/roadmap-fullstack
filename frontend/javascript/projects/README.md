# 🟨 JavaScript – Projects (Frontend)

This folder contains hands-on **JavaScript frontend projects**. Each one focuses on DOM manipulation, user interaction, and building dynamic UIs with vanilla JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Reinforce JS fundamentals through small web apps
- Practice real-world UI and logic without frameworks
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript only
- Implement form validation, localStorage, and APIs

## 🔨 Included Projects

| Name              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| search-app        | Search UI with dynamic filtering |
| shopping-cart     | Add/remove items with totals using JS |
| crypto-tracker    | Fetch and display crypto prices from API |
| email-sender      | Simulated email form with validations |
| todo-list-localstorage | Persistent to-do app using localStorage |

## 🚀 How to Run

Or use any simple web server.

## 📌 Notes

These projects form your **foundation** for moving to frameworks like React or Vue. Mastering vanilla JS is essential for understanding abstraction layers later on.
