# ðŸŸ¨ JavaScript (Frontend)

This folder contains exercises, examples, and projects for mastering **JavaScript**, the core language of the web. Everything here is done using **vanilla JavaScript**, without frameworks, to build a solid foundation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master DOM manipulation and client-side logic
- Understand data structures and control flow in JS
- Build functional web apps using JS only
- Prepare for frameworks like React and Vue

## ðŸ§  Subfolders

```

â”œâ”€â”€ basic/       # Fundamentals like variables, loops, and functions
â”œâ”€â”€ advanced/    # Closures, promises, async, modules, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/    # Small applications built with vanilla JS
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each folder includes a `README.md` explaining its content and purpose.

## ðŸš€ Tooling

- Live Server (VSCode)
- Vanilla JS only â€“ no libraries

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is the **language layer** of frontend development. Mastering JavaScript is essential for any frontend or full-stack developer.
