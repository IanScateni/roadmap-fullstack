# ⚛️ React.js – Basic

This folder contains beginner-friendly examples and concepts for learning the **fundamentals of React.js**. It’s the first step to building modern, component-based UIs.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Intro to JSX and React rendering
- Functional components vs class components
- Props and prop drilling
- State management with `useState`
- Lifecycle with `useEffect`
- Basic event handling
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering with `.map()`

├── PropsExample.jsx
├── StateExample.jsx
├── UseEffectExample.jsx
├── ConditionalRendering.jsx
├── ListRendering.jsx
├── EventHandling.jsx
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Use Vite or Create React App:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Ensure the root component is correctly imported in `main.jsx` or `index.js`.

## 📌 Notes

Once you're comfortable with this level, you’ll be ready to tackle routing, global state, and component reuse at scale in the `advanced/` section.
