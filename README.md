# 🧠 Full Stack Development Roadmap

Welcome to my structured and evolving **Full Stack Developer Roadmap**.  
This repository documents my journey to becoming a **Full Stack Software Architect**, focusing on backend, frontend, architecture, databases, DevOps, and core CS principles.

> 🔧 Built following the `Architect Track` structure and principles.

## 📁 Structure Overview

```
roadmap/
├── backend/        # Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, SQL, NoSQL
├── frontend/       # HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Vue.js
├── core/           # CS fundamentals: algorithms, OOP, design patterns, SOLID
├── common/         # Dev tools: Git, Docker, Linux, AWS
└── README.md
```

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master the **full stack lifecycle** from development to deployment.
- Apply **clean architecture**, **SOLID**, and **best practices** in all areas.
- Document hands-on exercises, concepts, and practical mini-projects per topic.
- Build a long-term reference to support my **transition to software architecture roles**.
